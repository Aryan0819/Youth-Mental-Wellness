MindMate AI 🧠
An empathetic AI companion for mental wellness, powered by Groq and Streamlit.

Overview & Purpose 💡
MindMate AI is a compassionate and innovative web application designed to support youth mental wellness. In a world where emotional struggles are often faced alone, MindMate offers a safe, private, and accessible space for users to reflect on their feelings. By providing personalized feedback, inspirational quotes, and calming visuals, it aims to foster a sense of connection and hope.

Features ✨
Mood-Based Reflections: Get an empathetic response from an AI assistant tailored to your specific mood.

Inspirational Quotes: Receive a thoughtfully selected quote that provides encouragement and perspective.

Personalized Poems: Generate a short, hopeful poem about your day to help you process your emotions.

Dynamic Visuals: View a calming image that matches your current emotional state, promoting relaxation.

How It Works 🛠️
This app is built with Streamlit, which provides a user-friendly and interactive web interface. It leverages the Groq API for high-speed, on-the-fly text generation, ensuring that all AI responses are delivered instantly. The application’s logic is self-contained in a single file, which simplifies deployment and removes the need for a separate backend server.
